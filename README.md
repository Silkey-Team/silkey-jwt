## Usage

### Sign In With Silkey

Redirect user to `sso.silkey.io/signin` with parameters. These parameters will be generated by the silkeySdk.

| Parameter    | Required | Type   | Desc                                                                                                                  |

### Installation

### Silkey Integration Guide

#### Information About Sandbox vs. Production

There are two versions of Athena (which you redirect to and authenticates the user) and Apollo (which registers the domain name of your application).
The version of Apollo that is used is determined by the Athena version, and isn't specified by the developer.
One uses an ethereum test network, where the ether has no monetary value, and the other is on the main ethereum network.

When in development, the test version of Apollo should be used.

The Sandbox Url: https://apollo-staging.silkey.io
The Production Url: https://apollo.silkey.io

A very small amount of ether is used to verify that the domain is registered.
To obtain free ether on the Rinkeby test network visit https://faucet.rinkeby.io/

#### Needed Preperations:

1.  Generate an ethereum wallet for the application, this wallet will be linked to the web domain of the application

- Visit https://metamask.io
- Download and add the extension to your browser
- Create an account for the application
- Click on account details then export private key to view and write down the private key

2.  Authenticate the domain of the application in Apollo with the generated wallet:

- Visit the propper Apollo url (see above)
- Login with metamask
- Click on Register Domain and enter domain of your application
- Click "Connect Existing Wallet" to use the metamask account
- Generate a challenge and add it into the DNS TXT record of the domain
- Verify the domain with DNS TXT records challenge
- Add logo url that will be displayed when a user is loging in using silkey
- Send a transaction which will save the registration

3.  Store the private key in a secure way inside the application, it will be used to generate the requestUrl

#### On Signin Page

```javascript
import silkeySdk from "@silkey/sdk";

// The needed data varaibles are:
// redirectUrl: Where the user is redirected after auth, this Url need to handle GET and POST requests as that is how the token is returned from Athena
// cancelUrl: Where the user is redirected if they cancel authentication
// scope: "email" or "id" email if you want access to the users email, otherwise id
// refId: (optional) This data will be returned to the program after authentication, and can be used to track previous actions before signup
// ssoTimestamp: (Optional) Time when params were generated, will be automatically generated if not present

// Example:
const requestParams = silkeySdk.generateSSORequestParams(privateKey, {
  redirectUrl: "https://domain/callback",
  cancelUrl: "https://domain/cancel",
  scope: "email",
  refId: "54321",
});

// Add the generated params to silkey url as queryString.
// ATHENA_URL: The url of the Athena webpage that is authenticating the user

// Example:
const silkeyRedirect = new URL((ATHENA_URL = "https://athena-staging.silkey.io"));
Object.entries(requestParams).forEach(([key, param]) => {
  silkeyRedirect.searchParams.append(key, param);
});

// Rediect to silkeyRedirect
```

#### On Callback Page

```javascript
import silkeySdk from "@silkey/sdk";

// providerUri: A web3 provider URI. ie: 'https://infura.io/v3/:infuraId' register at infura.io to get infuraId
// registryAddress: Address of silkey smart contract registry, see list of addresses in the registryAddress section of README.md
const silkeyPublicKey = await silkeySdk.fetchSilkeyPublicKey(providerUri, registryAddress);

// token: The token returned by Athena

// Using silkeyPublicKey is optional but recomended
const jwtPayload = silkeySdk.tokenPayloadVerifier(token, silkeyPublicKey);

if (jwtPayload === null) {
  // authorization failed
} else {
  const { address, email, refId } = jwtPayload;
  // address - use this as ID of the user
  // you are ready to go...
}
```
